# Stability-of-Causal-Graphs

In this repository I have outlined the resouces required for conducting the experiment to check for the stability of causal graphs. 

## Data

### [Data Folder](https://github.com/Aoishi28/Stability-of-Causal-Graphs/tree/main/data)
Here you can find all the data used in this project. So for running the experiment I dropped the first three columns from the original dataset. The first two columns had the same values for all rows and the third column had unique entries for all rows. Hence the files with Copy in their name were the updated versions that were used for the project. I chose 4 datasets : ant, synapse, ivy and camel.

## Code

### File 1: `filename1.ext`
This file is responsible for [describe the main functionality]. It contains functions such as [Function 1] and [Function 2] that [briefly describe what these functions do].

### File 2: `filename2.ext`
In this file, we handle [describe its role]. The main components include [Component 1] and [Component 2], which are used for [describe purpose or functionality].

### File 3: `filename3.ext`
This file's role is [describe its role]. It interacts with [mention other parts of the project] to [describe the outcome or purpose].
